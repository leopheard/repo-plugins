## The Collection

Prelinger Archives was founded in 1983 by Rick Prelinger in New York City.
Over the next twenty years, it grew into a collection of over 60,000 "ephemeral" films.

Prelinger Archives remains in existence, holding approximately 11,000 digitized and videotape titles and a large collection of home movies, amateur and industrial films acquired since 2002.
Its primary collection emphasis has turned toward home movies and amateur films, with approximately 17,000 items held as of Spring 2019.
Its goal remains to collect, preserve, and facilitate access to films of historic significance that haven't been collected elsewhere.
